# Search Node Frontend

This is a standalone frontend for the search node. It includes all HTML, CSS, and favicon assets, and connects to a backend node via a configurable address. Features include:

- Search bar
- Method sidebar (with icons)
- Support for islands and custom layouts
- Responsive design

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Set the backend node address in the UI.
3. Use the search bar and method sidebar to interact with your search node backend.

**Note:** This project does not include any backend code. The backend node must be running and accessible for the frontend to function.
